description: This is a classification machine learning project to develop an algorithm that can accurately predict employee access levels to Amazon's resources based on their role. The goal is to automate the granting of access privileges as employees enter new roles, minimizing manual oversight. The project will analyze a dataset of current Amazon employees with their provisioned accesses and job roles. Key steps include identifying the target variable of access status, selecting predictive features like job title, department, location, and tenure, checking for biases, splitting data into train and test sets, applying classification models like logistic regression and random forests, and comparing accuracy. The models will learn to map employee attributes to access levels. Overall, this project aims to reduce time-consuming access discovery cycles and enhance productivity by leveraging AI to automatically assign appropriate resource access to Amazon's workforce as their roles evolve.
